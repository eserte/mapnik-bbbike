BBBike Map Style for Mapnik
---------------------------

This is a fork of the "original german" Mapnik style
(svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/rendering/mapnik-german).

See README.mapnik-german for the original README of mapnik-german.


The following map and overlay definitions are available:

* bbbike.xml

  This is the base map.

* bbbike-smoothness.xml

  An overlay map for the smoothness. The color range is from green
  ("good quality") to red ("bad quality"). The "very good quality" is
  missing here; this map is only presenting smoothness degradations.

* bbbike-smoothness-solid.xml

  An overlay map similar to bbbike-smoothness.xml. Instead of dashed
  lines solid lines are used here; also the "very good quality"
  features are also shown.

* bbbike-handicap.xml

  An overlay map showing streets and ways where cyclists have to ride
  slower. The color coding is the similar to bbbike-smoothness. Red
  means essentially walking pace.

* bbbike-cycleway.xml

  An overlay map with cycleway. Blue are cycleway=track features, cyan
  are cycleway=lane features. Also shown (as orange) are bus lanes.

* bbbike-cycle-routes.xml

  Work in progress, not usable at the moment.
