German Map Style for Mapnik
---------------------------

This style closely follows the "original" Mapnik style 
(svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/rendering/mapnik). All
instructions and helper programs from that directory apply
equally to here, and changes made to that style could, and
often should, be patched in here as well. 

This style has been developed by Beate Braun for her Bachelor
Thesis at HFT Stuttgart, with support from Geofabrik. The 
style is made freely available here for anyone to use, subject
to any constraints possibly inherited from the original Mapnik
style.

This style is in use at http://www.openstreetmap.de/.

See http://www.openstreetmap.de/germanstyle.html for more.

There is a developer and maintainer mailinglist at
mapnik-de@lists.openstreetmap.de

To deploy this style use the supplied default.style file for
osm2pgsql and import data using the hstore extension of
PostgreSQL (-k switch of osm2pgsql).
